# FastMode
A stupidly fast and simple password manager built to fight virgins that use the exact same password for everything. It saves passwords on your computer so it works offline, it's less than 10kb, and the process of naming a password, generating it and approving it takes less than 5 seconds (in most cases).

NOTE: YOU WILL NEED A PYTHON 3 EDITOR TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Install the FastMode for macOS folder (duh)
BONUS STEP: If you haven't already, download IDLE to run this program.
	It was an option on Windows, but it's a requirement on macOS.
	Reason: macOS file directories suck.
2. Place it where you want. Literally, anywhere you want.
3. Spotlight search the FastModeMacOS.py file or open it manually
4. Run the program, save a password and read it to check if everything works (if it works, it should make a passlist.txt file and save a password in it)
5. Enjoy FastMode!
